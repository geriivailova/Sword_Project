# Sword_Project
Technical_test

Hello,

The application was developed using VisualStudio, which provided the necessary tools 
to create a reliable and efficient program. As part of the development process, 
I have defined the path for the sample text file as C:\Test. 
This means that for the program to execute as intended, the sample file must be located 
in the same directory. However, if necessary, 
the file path can be modified to suit your requirements.

In case you require any further information or assistance regarding the application, 
please do not hesitate to contact me (gerganapaskova01@gmail.com).
I am always available to answer any technical queries or provide additional details.
